# maptcha-node

Node.js powered live demo for [MAPTCHA](https://github.com/NejTech/maptcha).

Can be seen running [here](http://maptcha.nej.tech).

Contains a compiled executable from MATLAB Compiler that requires [MCR](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr.html) to run.

## Headless use
Even though this program runs completelly headless, MCR still needs xorg libraries to run image processing and figure display related functions.
